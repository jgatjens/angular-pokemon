### Use Gulp tasks

* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of your application in `/dist`
* `gulp serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
* `gulp serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
* `gulp wiredep` to fill bower dependencies in your `.html` file(s)
* `gulp injectjs` to fill angular modulos in your `.html` file(s)
